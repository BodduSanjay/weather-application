# Weather Finder Application

Welcome to the Weather Finder application! This project allows users to check real-time weather information for various cities around the world with ease. Whether you're planning a trip or just curious about the weather conditions, Weather Finder has you covered.

## Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It utilizes React for the frontend development, integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data dynamically.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Create React App**: Bootstrap React applications with no build configuration
- **react-icons**: Icon library for React applications
- **react-loader-spinner**: Provides a variety of loading indicators for React projects
- **styled-components**: CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: API used to fetch real-time weather data

## Application Functionalities

- **Search Weather**: Enter a city name to fetch current weather conditions from OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Display Weather**: Display weather information including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and weather description.
- **Change Theme**: Toggle between light and dark themes using a button in the header.
- **City Buttons**: Click on predefined city buttons to quickly check weather information for popular cities.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is usable and looks good across various screen sizes.
